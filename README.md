Welcome to the Hepatitis C Prediction Model repository! This repository contains a machine learning model to predict the status of Hepatitis C based on patient data. The model is built using a RandomForestClassifier and fine-tuned with GridSearchCV to achieve high accuracy.

Introduction:


Hepatitis C is a liver disease caused by the Hepatitis C virus. Early detection and diagnosis are crucial for effective treatment and management of the disease. This repository provides a RandomForest-based model trained on a dataset of medical test results to predict whether a patient has Hepatitis C.

Contents:


Dataset: The dataset used for training and testing the model is HepatitisCdata.csv.
Model: The repository includes the implementation of the RandomForest model and the best model selected by GridSearchCV.
Scripts: The repository contains scripts for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
